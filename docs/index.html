  <h1>DDLogger</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>DDLogger is my Something Awesome Project, focusing on Linux systems-level security.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Lightweight and efficient</li>
    <li>Compatible with any Linux distro</li>
    <li>Robust and resilient</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Report</h2>
  <p>Using Linux as my daily driver means I have many fun challenges to solve if I want to actually use my computer for any "normal" tasks. My speakers work about half the time, depending on whether I can get PulseAudio working. My AirPods work 100% of the time, as long as I call the script in the right state.</p>

  <h2>AirPods</h2>

  <p>Nice. See how, right at the end of the video, my AirPods script in the Bluetooth controller (bluetoothctl) leaks the output:</p>

  <pre>[NEW] Transport /org/bluez/hci0/dev_B0_3F_64_21_7E_D7/sep1/fd4</pre>
  <p>This shows the file descriptor for the Bluetooth audio transport stream between my computer and my AirPods.</p>

  <h2>Fan</h2>

  <p>I don't have access to the Alienware Command Center, so I created my own fan controller and manager. This was also achieved using file descriptors.</p>

  <h2>What does that have to do with anything</h2>
  <p>Similarly, ...</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>With DDLogger, tracking key events on Linux systems has never been easier. Our focus on security ensures that all data is handled responsibly.</p>
